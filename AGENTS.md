My goal is to take the file "assembly.txt" and translate it's contents into C code. Be as accurate as possible with your translations. I understand that this is challenging. That is why I will be making another pass over the translation once all of the assembly has been translated for the first time. Make sure to keep with the style and formatting in the C translation text files that are already present.
